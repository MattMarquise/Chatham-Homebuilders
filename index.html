        <h3>How We Started</h3>
        <p>Chatham Homebuilders and Remodelers is a second generation family-oriented company serving Savannah and the Lowcountry since
           1942.  Martin J. "Mike" Koncul, Sr., its founder, focused on integrity and quality, establishing a bond with each customer that resulted
           in a long-term loyal client base. His sons Michael and Stephen Koncul continue that tradition.</p>

          <p>For 38 years Michael and Stephen have built and remodeled some of Savannahâ€™s most beautiful homes with a hands-on approach and a
             desire to put customers first .  They continuously look for ways to improve their product with each and every home. Their attention
            to detail and quick response time to issues that may arise are what set them apart from other builders and remodelers.  Just like
            their father, they have developed a following of loyal clients who choose them again and again for their projects.</p>
            
            <p>Give Michael or Stephen a call and let them help you achieve your dream home or remodel project.</p>

      <h3>What our Clients are Saying</h3>
      <p>"I have nothing but the most positive opinion of Michael, the subs and the entire company.
        I have had a very good experience with my bathroom project and am now looking forward to 
        a new project in my den, so I know just who to go to...Chatham Homebuilders."  Cindy Castrillo </p>
      <p>"We have great gratitude for the devotion and professionalism that Chatham Homebuilders gave to building our new home.  From permits
        to the turn of the key we enjoyed their working their magic and building a home that was made for our family.  We appreciate your putting 
        up with our many questions before, during and after the construction of our home.  It is nice knowing you are still just a phone call away when we need you." Leigh and John Ebberwein</p>
      <p>"Michael and Stephen have done one new construction, two major renovations  and several minor projects for us over the last 24 years.  
        We keep coming back to them because we trust their judgement and know that every job will be done with the highest quality workmanship in a timely manner and at 
        a fair price.  They are conscientious, creative and fun to work with.  We consider them family. " Sherry and Jim Holtzclaw</p>
      <p>"We have much appreciation for the outstanding job in building our first (and last) home. We could not be more pleased.
        The process was easy from start to finish.  On time and on budget with a home that greatly exceeds our
        expectations--we could not have asked for more." Debra and Jeff Mahany
